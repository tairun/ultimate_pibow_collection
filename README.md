##Caution
> This Project is not yet complete and of little use to the public. Check back in about 2 weeks (from initial commit **1a98725** date). With the release of version 1.0 I will be taking requests.

##Goal
This project aims to provide all the cases (in pibow style) for the Raspberry Pi, of which you could ever dream of - in a simple way.

For now I'm working with a dwg-File. Later releases will feature dxf, Illustrator, etc files for the users convenience

##Sources
*gotta collect em all first*

##License
**As far as I'm concerned everything here is MIT, need to check though if I included some stuff with other licenses. Will be sorted out with the first release aka v1.0**
